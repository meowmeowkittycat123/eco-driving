## INTRODUCTION
A. Driving Safety and Sustainable Transport
Driving is a common and hazardous activity that is a prominent cause of death worldwide. Driver behavior represents a predominant cause, contributing to over 90% of crashes. Drivers adapt and drive safely in a broad range of situations but fail when expectations are violated or when feedback is inadequate. 
Relatedly, eco-driving is a style of vehicle driving that reduces energy consumption, maximizing mileage per unit of energy consumed. Eco-driving requires adherence to speed limits, accelerating and braking smoothly, avoiding acceleration, use of engine braking, and maintaining a constant speed. Eco-driving may also include vehicle maintenance, trip planning, switching to other transport where appropriate and vehicle choice. Eco-driving may save up to 25% of fuel. There is an overlap between eco-driving and safe driving since safe driving entails observing speed limits and avoiding harsh acceleration and braking.

B. Journey towards a ‚ÄúCar-Light Singapore‚Äù 
The recently released Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Draft Master Plan 2013 may be a developmental blueprint, but it is also very much a land transport road map - one which supplements the Land Transport Authority's own master plan.
It contains a strong two-pronged theme: reclaiming the city from the car and reducing the need to commute.
